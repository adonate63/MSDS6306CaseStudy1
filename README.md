#This is Case Study #1 for the MSDS 6306 Summer 2017 course:#

#Beers dataset contains a list of 2410 US craft beers and Breweries dataset contains 558 US
breweries. The datasets descriptions are as follows:

Beers.csv:
Name: Name of the beer.
Beer ID: Unique identier of the beer.
ABV: Alcohol by volume of the beer.
IBU: International Bitterness Units of the beer.
Brewery ID: Brewery id associated with the beer.
Style: Style of the beer.
Ounces: Ounces of beer.

Breweries.csv:
Brew ID: Unique identier of the brewery.
Name: Name of the brewery.
City: City where the brewery is located.
State: State where the brewery is located.
Questions

###The datasets have merged into one master dataset and detailed analysis has been accomplished on the data.###  
###The following questions have been answered during the analysis and these can be found in the MSDSCaseStudy1.Rmd file.###

1. How many breweries are present in each state?
2. Report the number of NA's in each column.
3. Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot
    a bar chart to compare.
4. Which state has the maximum alcoholic beer? Which state has the most bitter beer?
5. Display the Summary statistics for ABV (Alcohol by volume) variable.
6. Determine whether or not a relationship exists between the bitterness of the beer and its alcohol content; 
    Draw a scatter plot and analyze.
    
###The goal of the project:###

a. Introduction to the project. The introduction should not start with For my project I.
b. The introduction needs to be written as if you are presenting the work to someone who has given you the data 
    to analyze and wants to understand the result. In other words, pretend its not a case study for a course. 
    Pretend its a presentation for a client.
c. Brief explanations of the purpose of the code. The explanations should appear as a sentence or two before or 
    after the code chunk. Even though you will not be hiding the code chunks (so that I can see the code), you 
    need to pretend that the client cant see them.
d. Code to answer the seven questions above (plus the answers) in the same R Markdown file.
e. Clear answers to the questions. Just the code to answer the questions is not enough, even if the code is correct
    and gives the correct answer. You must state the answer in a complete sentence outside the code chunk.
f. Conclusion to the project. Summarize your ndings from this exercise. The le must be
    readable in GitHub.
    
###Deliverable: Markdown file uploaded to GitHub.###
